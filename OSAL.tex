\chapter{OS Abstract Layer (OSAL)}

OSAL provides an application programming interface (API) to an abstract
operating system making it easier and quicker to develop code for multiple
software or hardware platforms. It provides the same API regardless of the
underlying O/S; and the underlying hardware platform (i.e. embedded
motherboard).
