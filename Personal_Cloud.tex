\chapter{Personal Cloud}

There are nowadays many options to share your data on the cloud
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Amazon Cloud Storage: 
  
  \item  Google Drive:
   \$120 a year to get just one terabyte on Google Drive
  
  \item Dropbox
\end{enumerate}

You can choose option from harddrive using NAS (Sect.\ref{chap:NAS})
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Western Digital MyCloud
  
  \item Seagate Personal Cloud
\end{enumerate}
On both the Seagate and WD, all activity is encrypted, but having that much
stored on your wireless network means it's more important than ever to make
sure your wireless router is password protected, with WPA2 encryption enabled.
Overall WD's My Cloud apps were faster, cleaner and more stable. But the Seagate
Media apps have more features.

For a second harddrive as a backup: Seagate's Personal Cloud 2-Bay starts at
\$270 for a 4TB version (meaning 2TB of usable space); WD's My Cloud Mirror
starts at \$300.
