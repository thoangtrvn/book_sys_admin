\section{Modules/Setup file}

It is important to understand the file \verb!Modules/Setup! which is used by
makesetup script to construct the files 
\begin{verbatim}
Makefile
config.c
\end{verbatim}
from \verb!Makefile.pre! and \verb!config.c.in! files.

The file Setup itself is initially copied from Setup.dist; once it exists it
will not be overwritten, so you can edit.

Note that Makefile.pre is created from Makefile.pre.in by the toplevel configure
script.

Lines have the following structure:
\begin{verbatim}
//either this
<module> ... [<sourcefile> ...] [<cpparg> ...] [<library> ...]

//or this
<name> = <value>
// which defines a Make variable definition inserted into Makefile.in


//or this
 if a line contains just the word "shared" (without the
quotes but with the stars), then the following modules will not be
built statically. 


EXPLAIN first case:
<module> is anything else but should be a valid Python
  identifier (letters, digits, underscores, beginning with non-digit)
<sourcefile> is anything ending in .c (.C, .cc, .c++ are C++ files)
<cpparg> is anything starting with -I, -D, -U or -C
<library> is anything ending in .a or beginning with -l or -L

NOTE: (As the makesetup script changes, it may recognize some other
arguments as well, e.g. .so and .sl as libraries. See the big
case statement in the makesetup script.)
\end{verbatim}


How it works
\begin{verbatim}
1. Build all modules that are declared as static in Modules/Setup,
combine them into libpythonxy.a, combine that into python.

2. Build all modules that are listed as shared in Modules/Setup.


3. Invoke setup.py. That builds all modules that
a) are not builtin, and
b) are not listed in Modules/Setup, and
c) can be build on the target 
\end{verbatim}

\section{static linked to gcc}




To avoid an error likes
\begin{verbatim}
[tmhoangt@dccxl008 nts]$ python --version
python: /lib64/libc.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.14' not found (required by /opt/share/Python-2.7.11/x86_64/lib/libpython2.7.so.1.0)
\end{verbatim}
You may want to static link libgcc into the Python interpreter when you build
it.


\begin{verbatim}
./configure --disable-shared LDFLAGS="-static -static-libgcc" CPPFLAGS="-static" \ 
        --prefix=$HOME/.apps/Python-2.7.10


make -j10
\end{verbatim}
\subsection{Error 1}

In (make -j10), if you get the error such as
\begin{verbatim}
/usr/bin/ld: dynamic STT_GNU_IFUNC symbol `strcmp' with pointer equality in
`/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/4.5.2/../../../libc.a(strcmp.o)'
can not be used when making an executable;
recompile with -fPIE and relink with -pie
\end{verbatim}


NEXT step solution: remove -Xlinker --export-dynamic from the command
\begin{verbatim}
gcc -pthread -static -static-libgcc  -o python Modules/python.o libpython3.2m.a
-lpthread -ldl  -lutil   -lm

\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Error 2}

In (make install), if you get the error such as
\begin{verbatim}

\end{verbatim}

This means that you have not configured Modules/Setup correctly and need to:
\begin{itemize}
  \item add a single line (near the top): \verb!*static*! 
  
NOTE:  asterisk/star the word "static" and asterisk with no spaces
  
  \item uncomment all modules that you want to be available statically (such as
  math, array, etc...)
  
NOTE: Search for \verb!_struct! and 


NOTE: You may also need to add specific linker flags (as mentioned in the
following link). My experience so far has been that the libraries are working
without modification.

\end{itemize}


\subsection{Error 3}

\begin{verbatim}
./Modules/_testcapimodule.c: In function 'test_datetime_capi':
./Modules/_testcapimodule.c:1281: error: 'PyDateTimeAPI' undeclared (first use in this function)
./Modules/_testcapimodule.c:1281: error: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
./Modules/_testcapimodule.c:1281: error: for each function it appears in.)
./Modules/_testcapimodule.c:1293: error: 'PyDateTime_IMPORT' undeclared (first use in this function)
make: ***  Error 1
\end{verbatim}


Fix in \verb!Modules/_testcapimodule.c!

\begin{verbatim}
#ifdef Py_BUILD_CORE
#undef Py_BUILD_CORE
#include "datetime.h"
#define Py_BUILD_CORE
#else
#include "datetime.h"
#endif
\end{verbatim}
\url{http://bugs.python.org/issue19348}


\subsection{Error 4}


\begin{verbatim}
datetime.c not found
\end{verbatim}

For this kind of error, comment out the module that uses \verb!datetime.c! in
Modules/Setup file
\begin{verbatim}
#PyDateTime datetime.c
\end{verbatim}
